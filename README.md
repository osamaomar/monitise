i DIDNT WANT TO FOCUS ON THE CSS DESIGN SO MUCH, I WANTED TO PUT MY ATTENTION MORE ON THE FUNCTIONALITY. 

IN TERMS, OF OOP; I DEF UNDERSTOOD THEM AND AS I STARTED TO DEVELOP MORE AND MORE, I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO BUT I RAN OUT OF TIME. 

I WANTED TO CREATE MESSAGES OBJECT THAT IS ESENTIALLY AN ARRAY THAT HOLD THREE ITMES (USER, TEXT, TIME). EACH TIME A USER SEND A MESSAGES, THE ARRAY IS PUSHED TO THE OBJECT TO KEEP TRACK OF EACH MESSAGES, USERS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MESSAGE AND THE TIMESTAMP. 

I GOT TO THE POINT OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT I WANTED TO DO AND HOW I WAS GOING TO DO IT , BUT I RAN OUT OF TIME AND INSTEAD JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE EVENT MODEL IS GOOD TO GO. 

I DID NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS
